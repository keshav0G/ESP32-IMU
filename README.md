ESP32 MPU6050 Tilt Sensor with OLED Display and Web Server
This project demonstrates how to interface an ESP32 microcontroller with an MPU6050 IMU sensor to measure real-time temperature and 3-axis acceleration data, compute tilt angles (pitch and roll), and display this data both on an OLED screen and a web interface hosted by the ESP32.
